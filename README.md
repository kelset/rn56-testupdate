# rn56-testupdate

This sample repo shows the minimal number of steps necessary to update a RN proj to the new 0.56 version. 

Check the commit history for details of the things that I needed to do to ensure that the app was working fine in both Debug/Release builds for both Android/iOS.

**Disclaimer:** if you use Flow or Jest, the steps in this small TEST repo won't be enough. I suggest you check the 0.56 branch repo for the latest [.flowconfig](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/v0.56.0-rc.4/local-cli/templates/HelloWorld/_flowconfig#L67). Even better, I suggest you use the compare version from [rn-diff](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff) to ensure you update all the correct files.
